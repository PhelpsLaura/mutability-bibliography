####Descriptive Bibliography for *The Mutability of Human Life*

In an attempt to make a more user-friendly bibliography, this web app allows the user to chose what information to display about the anonymous 1777 novel *The Mutability of Human Life; or, Memoirs of Adelaide, Marchioness of Melville*. Site uses parallax design and partial rendering to compartmentalize the information. (And because I wanted to play with parallax.)
